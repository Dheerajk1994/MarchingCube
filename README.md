# MarchingCube
My implementation of the marching cube algorithm for procedural mesh rendering of 3 dimensional scalar data. Built for the Unity Engine using C#. 
The Marching Cube algorithm is used in many fields of software development. It is commonly used in 3D rendering of MRIs and deep scans. The algorithm is also used as a game development tool for rendering complex geometrical meshes. 
The code was made for my own personal use so it might not be optimal and might be missing certain functionalities that you might be looking for. But it is still a good place to start if you are interested in learning more about this amazing algorithm. 
This is the article I used when learning about it: http://paulbourke.net/geometry/polygonise/
